        HOW TO<br>LUCID DREAM
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        Lucid dreaming is when you’re conscious during a dream. This typically happens during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the dream-stage of sleep.

                    <div class = "content-section-description">
                    A reality check is a method of deducing whether one is in a dream or in real life. It usually involves an observation of some sort of sensory observation, usually visual. Most induced lucid dreams involve a reality check of some sort.<br>
                    <br>Types of reality checks:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Finger counting</li>
                        <li>Finger through palm</li>
                        <li>Looking at words and numbers</li>
                        <li>Breathing through a closed nose</li>
                        <li>Looking in a mirror</li>
                        <li>Light switches</li>
                    </ul>

                    AFFIRMATIONS
                </div>
                <div class = "content-section-description">
                    Each night before drifting off to sleep repeat the phrase 'I will remember my dreams as soon as I wake up'. Say this phrase over and over until you fall asleep, after a few days you will start to remember your dreams much more vividly.
                    As well as repeating affirmations, such as 'I will lucid dream' throughout your day. This will help boost progress towards lucid dreaming.

                <div class = "content-section-description">
                    Dream signs can be anything, for example: a person, a place, an object. They act as a cue to help you realise that you are dreaming once you the dream sign.

                    STAYING LUCID
                    </div>
                <div class = "content-section-description">
                    Once you realise you are dreaming, you can either perform a reality check to make sure you are or not. At this point, many struggle to remain lucid, so in order to stay lucid you should employ techniques such as spinning, rubbing your hands or touching the objects around you. The key is to remain calm so the dream doesn't fade.
